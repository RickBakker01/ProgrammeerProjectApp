# Day 1

I started with creating my map. I listened to the comments of the staff and decided to open the app with a map straight away. The map works for now. 


# Day 2

Something was wrong with my original repo. After talking to Renske, she tried saving it, but it didn't work. Had to make a new one. 
Furthermore, my map works now. onSavedInstanceState works as well.
